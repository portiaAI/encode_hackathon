# ENCODE HACKATHON

Welcome hackers! We are so excited to be working with you this weekend to create some fantastic AI agents.

As a reminder, the bounties are:
- First prize: £3K
- Second prize: £500

We want to see the coolest multi agent systems you can create! Extra kudos for nice UX, and for production grade agents that can have many end users.

## Running the examples

Fill out the .env file with the necessary API keys. You can get a Portia API key from our cloud dashboard: [app.portialabs.ai](https://app.portialabs.ai).

Run by doing e.g: `uv run 1_github_oauth.py`
